A simple client that provides SSO or opt-in authentication against a generic OAuth2 Server implementation.

### Description

This plugin allows to authenticate users against OpenID Connect OAuth2 API with Authorization Code Flow.
Once installed, it can be configured to automatically authenticate users (SSO), or provide a "Login with OpenID Connect"
button on the login form. After consent has been obtained, an existing user is automatically logged into WordPress, while 
new users are created in WordPress database.

#### Requirements

* PHP 5.4+ with the OpenSSL extensions enabled (Defuse encryption library) 

### Installation

1. Activate the plugin
1. Visit Settings > OpenID Connect and configure to meet your needs

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the client's Redirect URI?**

Most OAuth2 servers should require a whitelist of redirect URIs for security purposes. The Redirect URI provided
by this client is like so:  `https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=openid-connect-authorize`

Replace `example.com` with your domain name and path to WordPress.
